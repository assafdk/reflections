---- Lesson 2 ----

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1. a .git dir is created
2. we need it to track files later

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

1. the staging area lets you continue working on the files in it while it tracks them.
	it doesn't save them though.
2. it lets you choose to track some of the files in your directory while not tracking others.
