When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. when you collaborate with other people
2. when you use multiple devices to code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1. to have control on your local files. you don't wnat them to change every time someone changes the remote and thus changing the file you work on without you knowing this.
